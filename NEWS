  * We have made the move from Daybo::ConfReader to Config::IniFiles, this requires minor
    config changes, you must now put all _main parameters explicitly under [main],
    this is because libconfig-inifiles-perl is a common Debian package, where as Daybo
    Logic's internal config library isn't, as yet.

  * It's important to note that the subdirectories under ~/podcasts have changed,
    there are now separate directories for religion, politics, comedy etc.  These
    can be seen in a new [paths] section in the config file, and the keys of these
    directories can ne referenced from within each feed definition.
  * -n flag is now supported, to download one stream by the section name only.
