Daybo Logic Podget -- Add grabbing your favourite RSS Podcast feeds to cron.

This tool will allow you to maintain a simple config file in your home directory,
and then add running the dlpodget script to your personal crontab.  You can then
forget about missing your favourite feeds or religious sermons before they expire
upstream.
